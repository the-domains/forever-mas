if you ever have to go on vacation to get away from what you do, you should never come back.

don't get stuck into doing something you hate.

if you live for the weekends and you can't say that you dance to work...then please take a moment or many moments to figure out your strengths. always play to your main strengths and pursue those things.

help me, help yourself, help the world by doing something you love.
